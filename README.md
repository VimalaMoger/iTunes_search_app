# Project goal

  Created Music Search application and added pages for Artist, Track and Album listings, Header, Home, and Search. Created intermediate service, that uses http library to make requests. Made http calls     via Promises, also Observables, custom headers with the requests and handled errors. Implemented ***Client-side*** routing(requested response stored within browser) as known as ***Single Page Application***, mapping of URLs to components done via route configuration. 

  Router Guards to navigate between routes via router, and via template using routerLink directive.
  The urrently active route using routerLinkActive directive, variable parameters to routes via Parameterized routes, used ActivatedRoute to pass State/Id value to the component 
  
  Called the functions from activated route subscribe callback, and configured child routes(nested routes) in Artist page to render other components(Tracks and Albums or Videos)

  ## Tasks

- [x] Defined and configured the different URLs (routes) in your application
- [x] Configured navigation between those routes on the client side so the browser doesnâ€™t send a request to the server
- [x] Used Path location strategies used in Angular
- [x] Used parametrised routes where part of the URL is a variable
- [x] Implemented nested routes
- [x] implemented router guards to prevent certain people from accessing certain URLs
