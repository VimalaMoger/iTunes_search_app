# Project goal

> Created Music Search application and added pages for <b> Artist, Track and Album listings, Header, Home, and Search</b>.
  * Created service that uses HTTP library to make requests.
  * Made HTTP calls via Promises, and Observables, custom headers with the requests.
  * Implemented ***Client-side*** routing(requested response stored within browser) as known as ***Single Page Application***, mapping of URLs to components done via route configuration. 

> Router Guards to navigate between routes via router, and via template using routerLink directive.
> Called the functions from activated route subscribe callback, and configured child routes(nested routes) in Artist page to render other components(Tracks and Albums or Videos).

  ## Tasks

- [x] Defined and configured the different URLs (routes) 
- [x] Configured navigation between the routes on the client side so the browser doesnâ€™t send a request to the server
- [x] Used Path location strategies in Angular
- [x] Parametrised routes where part of the URL is a variable
- [x] Implemented nested routes
- [x] Implemented router guards to prevent free access
